# Notes

Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.

For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

[10, 343445353, 3453445, 3453545353453] should return 3453455.

# Domains

# Pomodoro 1 🍅 17:30:

- README and Notes ✅
- initial setup (organize function name and domain) ✅
- Domains searching ✅

- Testing case:

- Should return the the number 1 when the array [1, 2, 3, 4] are sended ✅

# Pomodoro 2  🍅 18:10

- Should return a array with the numbers [2, 3] when a array [4,3,2,5] are sended 🚧
- Refactoring of the first test case to find de lowest numbers on two different numbers 🚧
